# Education_Group_Project


## Selected Topic
The project will focus will focus on the education realm, specifically mathematics achievement. Two of the three members are currently classroom teachers and are passionate about student learning. 

### Data Source 
Initially, we hoped to explore data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). After exploring the website, it became clear we were more interested in individual student data which was not readily accessible. We chose to use a "fictional" dataset due to the ethical and legal concerns about using real student data. The data was generated from the following website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). This data set includes scores from three exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them.

### Question
What factors best predict mathematics achievement?

## Technologies, Languages, Tools, & Algorithms
* Python 
* SQL
* Jupyter Lab/ Notebook
* PostgreSQL/ PGAdmin
* Google Docs -QuickDB
* Google Slides


## The Plan
Supervised Machine Learning (logistic)

## Communication Protocol
A small group created in Slack. The expectation is that responses to a post is made by end of day. It is expected that group members would check Slack minimally, once per day. The protocol can be revisited during each class meeting to determine if it is meeting the group's needs.

### To Do List
* find data/ csv (done)
* commit resources on github
* set up ERD
* download ERD
* commit ERD to github
* set up tables in SQL
* connect CSV to tables in SQL
* commit deliverable from SQL
* join tables (in either SQL or via python in notebook)
* Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
* update presentation (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kom-E46sPTH8pOhf19zlzoUs71fJabneA08JeBoC3dM/edit?usp=sharing)

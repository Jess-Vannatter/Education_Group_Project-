# Education_Group_Project-
Group Project

## Selected Topic
The project will focus will focus on the education realm, specifically mathematics achievement. Two of the three members are currently classroom teachers and are passionate about student learning. 

### Data Source 
We chose to use a "fictional" dataset due to the ethical and legal concerns about using real student data. The data was generated from the following website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). 

### Question
What factors best predict mathematics achievement?

## Tools
PostgreSQL
Jupyter Notebook

## The Plan
Supervised Machine Learning, categorical?

## Communication Protocol
A small group created in Slack. The expectation is that responses to a post is made by end of day. It is expected that group members would check Slack minimally, once per day. The protocol can be revisited during each class meeting to determine if it is meeting the group's needs.

### To Do List

* commit resources on github
* set up ERD
* download ERD
* commit ERD to github
* set up tables in SQL
* connect CSV to tables in SQL
* commit deliverable from SQL
* join tables (in either SQL or via python in notebook)
* Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
